# CV Application (React)

This project is part of **The Odin Project** curriculum. It is built to practice understanding React State, Props, and form handling.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project currently focuses entirely on **Functionality & Logic**. No styling (CSS) has been applied yet, so the interface is raw HTML.
